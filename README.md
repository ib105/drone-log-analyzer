## How the Parser Works

The parser uses the `pymavlink` library to read ArduPilot .BIN files, which are binary telemetry logs generated by ArduPilot flight controllers.

### Parsing Process

1. **Connection Establishment**: Creates a MAVLink connection to the .BIN file using `mavutil.mavlink_connection()`

2. **Message Extraction**: Iterates through all messages in the log file and extracts relevant data based on message types:

   - **BAT (Battery)**: Extracts voltage (Volt) and current (Curr) measurements with timestamps
   - **VIBE (Vibration)**: Calculates vibration magnitude using the formula:
     ```
     magnitude = √(VibeX² + VibeY² + VibeZ²)
     ```
   - **GPS**: Extracts horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP) values
   - **RCOU (RC Output)**: Extracts PWM values for the first 4 motor channels (C1-C4)
   - **BARO (Barometer)**: Extracts altitude measurements

3. **Data Structure**: Organizes extracted data into a dictionary with arrays for each data type:
   ```python
   {
       'battery_voltage': [...],
       'battery_current': [...],
       'vibration': [...],
       'gps_hdop': [...],
       'motor_outputs': [[], [], [], []],  # 4 motors
       'altitude': [...],
       'timestamps': [...]
   }
   ```

4. **Time Conversion**: Converts microsecond timestamps (TimeUS) to seconds for easier analysis

### Telemetry Signals Extracted

The parser extracts **7 core telemetry signals**:

1. **Battery Voltage** - Monitors power supply health
2. **Battery Current** - Tracks power consumption
3. **Vibration (IMU)** - Detects mechanical issues
4. **GPS HDOP** - Measures GPS accuracy
5. **Motor Outputs (4 channels)** - ESC/PWM values for balance analysis
6. **Altitude** - Barometric altitude readings
7. **Timestamps** - Precise time tracking for all measurements

All signals are extracted gracefully - if any field is missing from the log, the parser skips it without errors.

## Anomaly Detection

The system implements **three rule-based anomaly detection algorithms**:

### 1. Voltage Sag Detection

**Purpose**: Identifies dangerous battery voltage drops that could lead to power loss

**Algorithm**:
```python
if voltage < 7.2V:  # threshold for 2S batteries
    flag as voltage sag event
```
- Compares each voltage reading against a safe threshold (default: 7.2V for 2S)
- Counts all instances where voltage falls below this threshold
- Records minimum voltage during sag events

**Significance**: Voltage sags can indicate:
- Battery degradation or damage
- Excessive current draw
- Imminent power failure risk

### 2. Vibration Spike Detection (Statistical Method)

**Purpose**: Detects abnormal mechanical vibrations that may indicate hardware issues

**Algorithm**:
```python
z = (vibration - mean) / std
if z > 3:  # 3 standard deviations
    flag as vibration spike
```
- Uses z-score statistical analysis to identify outliers
- Flags vibrations with z-score > 3 (99.7% confidence interval)
- Requires at least 2 data points and non-zero standard deviation

**Significance**: Vibration spikes can indicate:
- Loose propellers or hardware
- Motor bearing wear
- Structural damage or imbalance
- Improper propeller balancing

### 3. Motor Imbalance Detection

**Purpose**: Identifies motors operating at significantly different output levels

**Algorithm**:
```python
deviation = ((motor_avg - overall_avg) / overall_avg) * 100
if abs(deviation) > 15%:
    flag as motor imbalance
```
- Calculates average PWM output for each motor
- Computes overall average across all motors
- Flags motors with deviation > 15% from the mean

**Significance**: Motor imbalances can indicate:
- Motor degradation or failure
- ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) issues
- Propeller damage
- Flight controller calibration problems

## How the GPT-5 Integration Works

The application leverages OpenAI's GPT-5 model (`gpt-5-search-api-2025-10-14`) to provide expert-level flight analysis.

### Integration Architecture

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Aggregates flight statistics, anomaly counts, and key metrics
   - Calculates summary statistics (min, max, average values)
   - Structures data into JSON format for AI processing

2. **Prompt Engineering**:
   - **System Prompt**: Defines the AI's role as an expert in drone telemetry analysis
   - **User Prompt**: Provides structured flight data and requests analysis in 5 specific categories:
     1. Overall Flight Assessment (with quality rating)
     2. Critical Issues Identified
     3. Technical Observations (battery, vibration, motors, stability)
     4. Maintenance Recommendations (prioritized by urgency)
     5. Risk Assessment (with flight worthiness status)

3. **API Communication**:
   ```python
   response = client.chat.completions.create(
       model="gpt-5-search-api-2025-10-14",
       messages=[
           {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
           {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}
       ]
   )
   ```

4. **Response Processing**:
   - Extracts the AI-generated analysis from the API response
   - Displays formatted markdown in the Streamlit interface
   - Includes analysis in the downloadable report

5. **Key Features**:
   - **No Follow-up Questions**: Prompt explicitly instructs AI to provide definitive answers
   - **Structured Output**: Enforces consistent formatting across all analyses
   - **Technical Depth**: Leverages GPT-5's knowledge of aerospace engineering and drone systems
   - **Actionable Insights**: Focuses on practical maintenance recommendations and risk assessment

### Data Sent to AI

The integration sends a comprehensive summary including:
- Flight duration
- **Battery statistics**: min/max/avg voltage, average current
- **Vibration statistics**: max/avg vibration
- **GPS statistics**: avg/max HDOP values
- **Motor statistics**: number of motors analyzed
- **Altitude statistics**: maximum altitude reached
- **Anomaly details**:

  - Motor imbalance detection results

### Error Handling

The system includes robust error handling:
- Try-catch blocks around API calls
- User-friendly error messages displayed in the interface
- Fallback to "AI analysis unavailable" if API fails
- Continues report generation even if AI analysis fails
